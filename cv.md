## About me

I am a young and fast learning Front-End Developer. Ever since my school years, I have had a passion for web development, so over the past year, I have been actively self-taught. During the learning process, I developed a clear strategy of self-discipline, time management and became more assertive. As a result, today I have such skills as HTML5, SASS, GIT, JavaScript, React JS, and Redux Toolkit - and I'm not going to stop there.

## Code example

    let timeout;
    return (...arg) => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      timeout = setTimeout(() => fn(...arg), wait);
    };
  };
```

## Experince

### [Project: Redux-Burger](https://github.com/ShchokinViktor/redux-burger)

Redux Burger is a burger delivery web application written in React JS with Redux as the global state manager.
I used the mocAPI service as an API, where I later fetched requests, keeping all the business logic in Redux using the Redux toolkit, including the Redux Async Thunk.
Implemented TypeScript, carried out basic typing of components, as well as all Redux logic.
For styling, I used styles written from scratch using SCSS modules.

### [Project: React-Pokemon](https://github.com/ShchokinViktor/react-pokemon)

React-Pokemon is a Pokemon-themed web application written in React JS, where the design was developed by me in Figma.
In the project itself, I used a component approach to development based on the BEM methodology, and the styling was written from scratch using the SASS preprocessor and mobile-first approach.
Set up basic routing with React JS, adding Code Splitting to improve performance.
I used Context to pass data between components, in the future I plan to transfer all state management and business logic to Redux.
