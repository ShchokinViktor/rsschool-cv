## About me

I am a young and fast learning Front-End Developer. Ever since my school years, I have had a passion for web development, so over the past year, I have been actively self-taught. During the learning process, I developed a clear strategy of self-discipline, time management and became more assertive. As a result, today I have such skills as HTML5, SASS, GIT, JavaScript, React JS, and Redux Toolkit - and I'm not going to stop there.

## Code example

    let timeout;
    return (...arg) => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      timeout = setTimeout(() => fn(...arg), wait);
    };
  };
```
